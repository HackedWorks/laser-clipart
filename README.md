# laser-clipart
A collection of SVG's for cutting and engraving with a laser (or other machines and tools).

The paths for cutting, vector engraving and raster engraving are on separate layers and in addition each layer has a color associated to it as some laser and cnc controler software uses colors for specific operations. The files adhere to the colors used by the K40Whisperer software (http://k40.scorchworks.com/K40whisperer/k40whisperer.html). 

In addition the files also contain a layer with license information and references to the original work where appropriate.
